# python_reddit_scraper
This is a python data scrapper. I had originally developed this for a client that wanted a way to scrape data from reddit for his YT reddit channel. The one I have uploaded on github is
a water downed version of the one I made for my client. This version is capable of getting the comments, likes, and the length of the comment for all the comments in the reddit thread you entered.
The final version which my client has not only fetched said information, it was capable of searching for specific keywords, you could enter as many as you want, the application will search for them in each comment.
This is a simple app that can be used as soon as you download it from github. Once downloaded, click on the following files: script_manager -> dist -> hell -> scroll down to the hell application file and click.
Once the command prompt pops up, copy and paste the reddit url with no spaces and hit enter. Then enter whatever you want to name the csv file with no spaces. The application will create the csv file you named in that directory.
